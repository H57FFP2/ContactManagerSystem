# Contact Manager System
- Created a program contact manager to help me learn in more depth the c++ language.
- Comes with and add contact function to create a contact, remove function to remove a contact and another function to show the list of contacts added.
- A contact stores a name, phone number and mail address for the moment. 
I will add more fields in the future like normal adress, nicknames and notes.

# How does it work
- The only features that are working for the moment is the add a contact function and even this function need somme fixing such as verification to validate email format and phone number format.

# Core code location
Core code is located at main.cpp, F_ContactManagerFunction.cpp and C_ContactClass.cpp
